# last.fm dupe finder

---

Simple web app used to identify potential track or album duplicates in your last.fm library. 

Those of us deranged enough to record every song we've ever listened to know the drill: deluxe albums, 15-year anniversary editions, remasters, (Taylor's Version)'s... we know it's all the same, but last.fm does not.

Enter **last.fm dupe finder**. Just type in your username and this app will look through your entire library and display a table full of all the duplicates you have, along with handy links to go edit them yourself.
